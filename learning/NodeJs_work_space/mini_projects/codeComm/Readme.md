Social Media Website - Full Stack Project
-----------------------------------------

This project is a full-stack social media website that I developed as part of my web development journey. The goal was to create a feature-rich platform where users could interact, share posts, and engage with others in real-time.

### Technologies Used:

-   Frontend: HTML, SCSS (Sass), JavaScript (JS)
-   Backend: Node.js, Express.js
-   Database: MongoDB
-   Libraries and Tools: Passport.js, Nodemailer, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Socket.IO

### Features:

1.  User Registration and Login: Implemented a secure user registration and login system with Google OAuth integration for seamless authentication.

2.  Post Management: Created robust features for users to create, edit, and delete their posts, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience.

3.  Real-Time Interactions: Facilitated engaging user interactions through comments and implemented Socket.IO to enable real-time updates and live notifications.

4.  Database Management: Utilized MongoDB for efficient data storage and management of user profiles, posts, and comments.

5.  Email Notifications: Implemented server-side scripting with Nodemailer to send email notifications and verifications to users.

6.  Security Measures: Ensured website security by implementing measures against common web vulnerabilities and performed data validation for user inputs.

### Duration:

The project was developed from December 2022 to March 2023.

### GitHub Repository:

This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in full-stack web development and work with various technologies commonly used in building dynamic web applications. The social media website offers a user-friendly interface and demonstrates my ability to deliver a seamless and engaging user experience.
